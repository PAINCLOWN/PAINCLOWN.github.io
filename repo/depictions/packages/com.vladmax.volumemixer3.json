You can display all of the controls in the mixer at the same time, or choose to hide the ones you do not need.Several skins are included, in addition to stock iOS look (which you can fully customize by changing colors of text, sliders and thumb grabbers).You can configure it in Settings/Volume Mixer 3, and open it using any Activator action.
